## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**

Send details to: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)

### 3. **Include the following information**

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### 4. **Response timeline**

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

- **Input validation**: All user input is validated on the server
- **XSS prevention**: No user-generated content is directly rendered
- **CSRF protection**: WebSocket connections don't use cookies

### Server-Side Security

- **Input sanitization**: All client data is validated before processing
- **File system access**: Limited to designated directories
- **WebSocket security**: Connection validation and role-based access

### Data Protection

- **Password hashing**: Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes in `packages/server/data/users.json`
- **Local data**: Maps and user data stored locally on the server
- **No external services**: No third-party data transmission

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Keep Node.js updated** to latest stable version
- **Run behind firewall** for production deployments
- **Regular backups** of map data

### For Developers

- **Validate all inputs** on the server side
- **Use TypeScript** strict mode for type safety
- **Regular dependency updates** for security patches
- **Code review** for security-sensitive changes

## 🚫 Known Limitations

### Current Security Limitations

- **Optional encryption**: WebSocket connections are not encrypted by default (use reverse proxy + TLS)
- **File system access**: Server has read/write access to maps and users directories
- **No rate limiting**: No protection against spam or DoS attacks

### Planned Security Improvements

- **2FA / stronger auth**: Optional two-factor authentication
- **HTTPS/WSS support**: Built-in TLS or documented reverse proxy
- **Input rate limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Audit logging**: Security event tracking

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Production security settings
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
LOCATIONS_DIR=/secure/path/to/maps
```

### Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Allow only necessary ports
ufw allow 8080/tcp  # WebSocket server
ufw deny 22/tcp    # SSH (if not needed)
```

### Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

Use nginx or similar for production:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```
